EX: 2

FILES:
uthreads.h -- a file give by you ->
uthreads.cpp -- implenetations of the API of libuthreads
Schedueler.h -- Schedueler class header file
Schedueler.cpp -- Schedueler class implementations
uthread_utils.h -- some useful includes and macros
arch_utils.h -- declaration of the translate address function
arch_utils.cpp -- implementation of the translate address function

REMARKS:
I used a class to represent the schedueler with some queues and lists, 
I've tried to make sure that nothing breaks when removing or 
adding threads from the queues and lists, which should be working.
As a whole, whilst implementing I was debating with myself how much I should "reinvent the wheel", i.e making a thread struct from scratch and using shared pointer, which would have been some useful clarification.
